GalaxyHackers is an innovative toolkit for astronomical data analysis, with a focus on galaxy cluster detection.
The project provides utilities for building, training, and evaluating machine learning models specifically tailored to the unique challenges of astrophysical datasets.

Key Features
************

-  Fetches and processes astronomical data.
-  Annotates and visualizes galaxy images dynamically.
-  Trains and evaluates YOLO models for galaxy and cluster detection.

Features
********
-  Supports a variety of deep learning models: ResNet18, EfficientNet, DenseNet, ViTL16, etc.
-  Integrates with Comet ML for tracking training experiments.
-  Includes automatic segmentation plot generation after model training.
-  Provides flexibility in choosing optimizers, learning rate schedulers, and hyperparameters.
